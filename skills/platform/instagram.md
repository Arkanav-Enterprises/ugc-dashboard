# Instagram — Platform Rules

## Key Differences from TikTok

- **Hashtags**: 5-10 (vs TikTok's 5 max). Put in caption, not first comment.
- **Algorithm priority**: Saves and shares > likes and comments (opposite of [[tiktok]])
- **Watermarks**: Remove TikTok watermark if cross-posting — IG algorithm deprioritizes TikTok-watermarked content
- **Caption length**: Can be longer than TikTok. 200-400 characters works well.
- **Sound**: IG has its own trending audio. Don't use TikTok sounds on IG.

## Content Optimization for IG

Since saves and shares are the top signals:
- Transformation content ([[content-mix]] Category C) performs relatively better on IG
- Educational hooks ("here's what X days of manifesting actually does") get saved
- "Tag someone" CTAs drive shares more effectively on IG than TikTok
- Stat content ([[content-mix]] Category A) gets shared because it feels personally relevant

## Posting Schedule

- 1 post per day per account (same cadence as [[tiktok]])
- Best times: 9am, 12pm, 6pm (test and adjust)
- Use IG's native scheduling for consistency

## Cross-Posting Strategy

The same video can go on both TikTok and IG with these adjustments:
1. Remove TikTok watermark
2. Swap the trending sound (use IG-native audio)
3. Expand the caption slightly (IG audiences read more)
4. Adjust hashtags (more niche ones, 5-10 total)
5. Keep the text overlays identical — they're platform-agnostic
