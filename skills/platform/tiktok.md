# TikTok — Platform Rules

## The "Never Name the App" Rule

**NEVER mention "Manifest Lock" in the caption, text overlay, or anywhere visible.** This is the single most important TikTok-specific rule.

**Why:** When people can't find the app name, they ask "what app is this?" in the comments. Comments are TikTok's #1 ranking signal. Every comment asking about the app is:
- Free algorithmic reach (TikTok promotes commented videos)
- A warm lead (they're actively interested)
- A chance for direct engagement (reply to each one individually — each reply counts as another comment)

The app should be discoverable only through the bio link, not through the caption.

## Posting Rules

- **1 post per day per account** (current cadence)
- **Best times to test**: 8am, 1pm, 7pm IST — adjust based on analytics
- **Always draft first**, review the text overlays and caption before publishing
- **Add trending sound manually** before publishing — see [[caption-formulas]] for why sound matters
- Sound selection: search TikTok's trending sounds in the target niche (manifestation, self-improvement, screen time)

## Caption Format

- Short — 100-200 characters before hashtags
- Max 5 hashtags (see [[caption-formulas]] for mix strategy)
- Story-style, soft CTA or question
- No hashtag walls, no emoji walls

## The 500-View Floor Rule

If you can't break 500 views after 5+ consistent posts, **pause for 2-3 days**. The problem is content quality, not frequency.

Posting more bad content trains the algorithm to suppress your account. During the pause:
1. Study competitor content (sort by Popular on similar accounts)
2. Review [[proven-hooks]] for what works elsewhere
3. Refresh the hook angle — see [[hook-architecture]] for alternatives
4. Come back with a new format or hook style

## Algorithm Signals (Ranked by Importance)

1. **Watch time** — percentage of video watched and replays. Short videos (7-14 seconds per [[video-format]]) naturally get higher watch-through rates.
2. **Comments** — the "never name the app" rule exploits this directly
3. **Shares** — "tag someone who needs this" CTAs drive shares (but use sparingly)
4. **Saves** — educational or transformation content gets saved
5. **Follows from video** — indicates the content attracted the right audience

## Business vs Personal Account

- **Personal account**: Access to trending/viral sounds (critical for reach)
- **Business account**: Analytics, but cannot use viral sounds
- **Recommendation**: Use personal accounts for @sanyahealing and @sophie.unplugs
