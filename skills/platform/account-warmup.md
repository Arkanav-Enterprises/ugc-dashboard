# Account Warmup — New Account Protocol

## Why Warmup Matters

Both TikTok and Instagram categorize new accounts by what they engage with. If you post before training the algorithm, your content gets pushed to random audiences and dies.

## Day 1-2 Protocol (Before First Post)

1. **Scroll 15 min/day** in the target niche ONLY: manifestation, screen time, self-improvement, habit building, digital detox
2. **Like** 10-15 posts from creators in the space
3. **Comment** on 5-10 posts (genuine, not "nice post!" — the algorithm watches comment quality)
4. **Follow** 10-20 creators in the niche
5. **Do NOT post** anything yet

## Day 3+: First Posts

- Start with 1 post/day
- Scale to 2/day only after finding a format that works (see [[tiktok]] 500-view floor rule)
- Never scale beyond 3/day — quality over quantity always

## Rules

- Never buy old accounts — they have a locked-in audience you can't change
- Same email for multiple accounts is fine if scaling later
- Keep engagement activity in-niche even after posting begins
