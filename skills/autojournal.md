# AutoJournal — Product Knowledge

## What It Is
AutoJournal is an iOS app that reads your camera roll and writes a weekly journal entry automatically. You take photos throughout the week, and every Sunday the app generates a beautifully written journal entry from your memories — no typing required.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Zero effort journaling** — your photos tell the story, the app writes it
- **Weekly ritual** — one journal entry per week, delivered Sunday morning
- **Camera roll = journal** — the photos you already take become journal entries
- **Private by design** — all processing on-device, entries stored locally

## Key Features
- Reads camera roll photos from the past week
- Uses on-device AI to identify moments, places, people, food, activities
- Generates a natural, personal journal entry in your voice
- Beautiful reading experience with photos inline
- Export to PDF, share entries, or keep private
- Customizable writing style (casual, reflective, detailed)

## Target Audience
- Gen Z and millennial women (18-30)
- People who want to journal but never stick with it
- Photo-heavy phone users (food, friends, travel, daily life)
- "I wish I journaled but I'm too lazy" crowd

## Tone for Reels
- Casual, authentic, lowercase okay
- First person — "i" not "I"
- Relatable lifestyle content, not tech demos
- Show the magical moment of reading your auto-generated entry
- Never hard-sell — let the product speak through screen recordings

## What NOT to Say
- Don't call it "AI journaling" — feels cold
- Don't over-explain how it works — keep it magical
- Don't compare to other journaling apps
- Don't mention data/privacy in hooks — save for comments/replies

## Screen Recording Context
The screen recordings show:
- Opening the app to find a new journal entry
- Scrolling through a beautifully written entry with photos
- The "wow" moment of reading about your own week
