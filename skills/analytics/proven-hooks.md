# Proven Hooks — What Actually Worked

This is a living document. Update after each weekly review from [[performance-loop]].

## How to Use This File

1. **Before generating**: Scan this list to avoid accidentally repeating a recent hook
2. **For inspiration**: Use proven hooks as templates — change the specific numbers/people but keep the structure
3. **Pattern matching**: Look for common traits among winners (category, emotion, number type)

## Hall of Fame (Top Performers)

*Updated as performance data comes in. Format: Hook | Category | Persona | Views | Engagement Rate*

<!-- Add entries as posts go live and perform -->

| Hook | Cat | Persona | Views | Eng% | Date |
|------|-----|---------|-------|------|------|
| *(awaiting first week of data)* | | | | | |

## Patterns Emerging

<!-- Update weekly — what do the winners share? -->

**Hook structures that work:**
- *(to be filled after first review cycle)*

**Numbers that resonate:**
- *(track which specific stats get the most engagement)*

**Personas that outperform by category:**
- *(track if Sanya or Sophie performs better per category)*

## Recently Used (Anti-Repetition Check)

The pipeline checks this section before generating to avoid reusing hooks within a 14-day window.

<!-- Last 14 days of hooks — auto-updated by pipeline -->

| Date | Persona | POV Text | Reaction Text |
