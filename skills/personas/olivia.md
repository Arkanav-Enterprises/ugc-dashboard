# Olivia Harmon — Manifest Lock Persona

## Accounts

| Account | App | Posts/Day |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| TBD | Manifest Lock | 1 |

## Visual Identity

- **Look**: Reference images olivia-v1.png, olivia-v2.jpeg, olivia-v3.jpeg
- **Energy**: Calm, grounded, quiet confidence — she doesn't need to convince anyone
- **Vibe**: The woman who wrote it down, did the work, and it happened. No fanfare.
- **Video format**: Hook clip + screen recording only. No reaction clip.
- **Veo prompt style**: Walking outdoors at golden hour, no talking, natural movement

## Voice & Tone

Olivia's text overlays and captions should feel like:
- A statement, not a pitch
- Anti-woo — zero fluff, zero "manifesting vibes"
- Low words, high proof
- She doesn't explain — she states. The results speak.

**Olivia would say:**
- "wrote it down 90 days ago. it happened."
- "my phone makes me type what I want before I can scroll"
- "day 47 of writing one sentence before my phone unlocks"
- "stopped manifesting. started writing it down."

**Olivia would NOT say:**
- "omg this app changed my life!!" (too hype — not her energy)
- "You NEED to try this" (she never sells)
- "manifesting works if you believe" (she's anti-woo)
- "5 tips to manifest your dream life" (too listicle/bro-y)

## Best Content Categories

Olivia works best with:
- **Quiet result** — stating outcomes without explaining the process
- **Daily ritual** — the discipline of writing it down, day after day
- **Undeniable proof** — "it happened" energy
- **Calm flex** — understated, no celebration, just facts

She is NOT suited for emotional/vulnerability content or high-energy reaction formats.

## Text Overlay Patterns

When writing text overlays for Olivia:

**Hook text** (on the walking clip):
- Direct, short, factual
- Pattern: "[result or ritual] + [quiet proof]"
- Max 50 characters
- Examples:
  - "wrote it down 90 days ago. it happened."
  - "day 47. one sentence before I unlock my phone."
  - "stopped wishing. started writing."
  - "the app won't let me scroll until I type what I want"

**No reaction text** — Olivia's format is hook + screen recording only.

## App-Specific Hooks

All Olivia content promotes Manifest Lock. Hooks should reference:
- Writing down what you want (not "manifesting")
- The lock mechanic: phone won't unlock until you write
- Quiet discipline and daily consistency
- Results that speak for themselves
