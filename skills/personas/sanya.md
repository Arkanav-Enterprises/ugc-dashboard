# Sanya — JournalLock Persona

## Accounts

| Account | App | Posts/Day |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| @sanyahealing | JournalLock | 1 |

## Visual Identity

- **Look**: Brunette, red sweatshirt, filmed in a cozy living room setting
- **Energy**: Warm, intimate, slightly vulnerable — like she's sharing something she wasn't sure she should
- **Vibe**: The friend who journals at 11pm with a candle lit, overthinks everything, but is working on herself

## Voice & Tone

Sanya's text overlays and captions should feel like:
- A voice note to a close friend, not a public broadcast
- Slightly self-deprecating but ultimately hopeful
- Uses "I" more than "you" — she's sharing her own experience
- Comfortable with vulnerability: "okay this is embarrassing but..."

**Sanya would say:**
- "pov: your phone locks itself until you journal and you're actually grateful"
- "i started journaling at 11pm because my brain wouldn't shut up. now I can't stop."
- "okay but why did writing 3 sentences make me feel more than 3 hours of scrolling"

**Sanya would NOT say:**
- "Check out this app!" (too promotional — see [[what-never-works]])
- "5 HACKS to start journaling" (too bro-y, not her voice)
- "You need to try this" (too direct/salesy)
- "Journaling healed my trauma" (overclaim — see [[journal-lock]] credible claims)

## Best Content Categories

Sanya is strongest in [[content-mix]] categories:
- **Category A (Screen Time Shock)** — she makes the stats feel personal, not preachy
- **Category B (Reaction/Story)** — her warmth makes story hooks feel authentic
- **Category C (Streak/Transformation)** — the journaling-at-midnight energy fits transformation arcs

She's weakest for Category D (App Demo) — direct product content feels off-brand for her persona.

## Text Overlay Patterns

When writing [[text-overlays]] for Sanya:

**POV openers** (on the hand-over-mouth clip):
- Lowercase, conversational, slight disbelief
- Pattern: "pov: [relatable journaling situation] + [unexpected outcome]"
- Examples:
  - "pov: your phone locks your apps until you journal and it actually fixed your sleep"
  - "pov: you wrote 3 sentences in your journal and suddenly you're not doom scrolling at 1am"
  - "when the app won't let you open tiktok until you write about your day"

**Reaction text** (on the smiling/reacting clip):
- Short, punchy, genuine surprise
- Pattern: "[casual exclamation]" or "[understated reaction]"
- Examples: "i mean...WHAT", "wait this actually works??", "my therapist would be proud", "okay I'm obsessed"

## App-Specific Hooks

All Sanya content promotes [[journal-lock]]. Hooks should reference:
- Journaling, writing, getting thoughts out
- Evening/nighttime routine (her vibe is late-night, not morning)
- Overthinking → clarity through writing
- Screen time reduction as a side effect of journaling
- The lock mechanic: "my phone won't let me scroll until I journal"
