# Sanya — JournalLock Persona

## Accounts

| Account | App | Posts/Day |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| @sanyahealing | JournalLock | 1 |
| @sophie.unplugs | JournalLock | 1 |

**Important:** Sanya has two accounts for the same app. The daily content for @sanyahealing and @sophie.unplugs must use **different hooks, different text overlays, and different captions** each day. Same voice, same look, but never duplicate content. The pipeline generates two separate posts for Sanya daily.

## Visual Identity

- **Look**: Dark hair, band tee, filmed in an outdoor park setting
- **Energy**: Grounded, slightly dry, matter-of-fact — like she tried something skeptically and it just... worked
- **Vibe**: The friend who doesn't do woo-woo stuff but somehow has a 30-day streak. Reluctant convert energy.

## Voice & Tone

Sanya's text overlays and captions should feel like:
- Dry observation, not emotional confession
- Slightly skeptical framing even when sharing wins — "I can't believe I'm saying this but..."
- Uses "you" and "we" more than Emilly — she's including the viewer, not confessing to them
- Humor over vulnerability: deadpan, not dramatic

**Sanya would say:**
- "pov: you actually touched grass because an app locked your phone"
- "my screen time went from 7 hours to 45 minutes and honestly I'm scared"
- "day 14 of journaling and my roommate thinks I've joined a cult"

**Sanya would NOT say:**
- "This healed my inner child" (too spiritual for her voice)
- "omg I'm literally crying" (too emotionally heightened — that's [[emilly]]'s territory)
- "Check out this app!" (too promotional — see [[what-never-works]])

## Best Content Categories

Sanya is strongest in [[content-mix]] categories:
- **Category A (Screen Time Shock)** — her dry delivery makes shocking stats land harder
- **Category B (Reaction/Story)** — the skeptic-turned-believer arc is her signature
- **Category C (Streak/Transformation)** — "day X of doing the thing" fits her reluctant-convert energy
- **Category D (App Demo)** — she can make product content feel organic because of her "just showing you what happened" framing

Sanya is the more versatile persona. She can carry all four categories credibly.

## Text Overlay Patterns

When writing [[text-overlays]] for Sanya:

**POV openers** (on the hand-over-mouth clip):
- Lowercase, dry, slightly deadpan
- Pattern: "pov: [mundane setup] + [surprisingly real outcome]"
- Examples:
  - "pov: you replaced 3 minutes of scrolling with journaling and now you have a 21-day streak"
  - "pov: an app locked your phone until you wrote in your journal"
  - "my screen time after 30 days of journaling every night:"

**Reaction text** (on the smiling/reacting clip):
- Short, understated, the humor is in the restraint
- Pattern: "[matter-of-fact observation]" or "[reluctant admission]"
- Examples: "the app ate", "okay fine it works", "i'm not even mad", "well that happened", "noted."

## App-Specific Hooks

All Sanya content promotes [[journal-lock]]. Hooks should reference:
- Journaling, writing, getting thoughts out
- Evening routine (winding down, reflection)
- Skepticism → results through consistency
- Screen time reduction as a direct outcome of daily journaling
- The lock mechanic: "my phone won't let me scroll until I journal"

## Differentiating the Two Accounts

When generating two posts per day for Sanya:
- Assign **different categories** to each account (e.g., @sanyahealing gets Cat A, @sophie.unplugs gets Cat B)
- Never use the same POV text or reaction text across both accounts on the same day
- Different screen recordings for each
- Captions should have different story angles even if the hook tier is the same
