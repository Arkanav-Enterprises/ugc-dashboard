# JournalLock — Product Knowledge

## What It Is

An iOS app that blocks distracting apps until users complete daily journaling. Users set a journaling time, the app locks their distracting apps at that time, and they stay locked until the user journals for the day. Same core mechanic as [[manifest-lock]] but centered on journaling instead of manifestation.

## Core Value Propositions (ranked by hook potential)

1. **"Your apps stay locked until you journal"** — the unique blocking mechanic. Lead with this in [[hook-architecture]] Tier 1 and Tier 3 hooks.
2. **"3 minutes of journaling to earn your screen time"** — time swap framing. Works for [[text-overlays]] POV openers.
3. **"Your phone won't let you scroll until you write about your day"** — visceral description. Best for curiosity-gap hooks.
4. **"Build a journaling streak that actually sticks"** — gamification angle. Best for [[content-mix]] Category C.
5. **"AI-generated journal prompts based on your mood"** — tech angle. Use sparingly, Category D only.

## Target Audience

### Primary: The Doom Scroller (18-28)
Knows they waste hours on their phone, feels guilty. Hook angle: screen time stats, "what if you journaled instead of scrolled." This audience responds to [[sanya]]'s warm, relatable energy.

### Secondary: The Aspiring Journaler (22-35)
Wants to journal but can't build the habit. Has bought notebooks that sit empty. Hook angle: "I tried journaling every day for 30 days, here's what happened."

### Tertiary: The Overthinker (20-32)
Journals sporadically, usually at night when thoughts are racing. Hook angle: "my brain at 11pm vs after I journal." This is [[sanya]]'s core audience.

## App Features (Content-Relevant)

- **Mood check** (emoji slider) — visually appealing, personalized experience
- **AI journal prompts** — generated based on mood, so you're never staring at a blank page
- **Scheduled lock time** — user picks when apps lock (e.g., 9pm), forced journaling before unlock
- **App blocking with shield overlay** — the "earn your screen time" mechanic
- **Streak tracking** — gamification, shareable milestones
- **Unlock timer with countdown** — visual urgency after journaling is complete

## Key Differences from ManifestLock

| Trigger | Morning practice → unlock apps | Scheduled time → apps lock until you journal |
| Content tone | Aspirational, manifestation energy | Reflective, emotional processing |
| Best persona | Sophie (grounded, practical) | Sanya (warm, overthinker) |

## What We Never Say

- Never claim journaling will cure anxiety or depression — see [[what-never-works]]
- Never directly ask people to download — see [[tiktok]] "never name the app" rule
- Credible claims only: reduced screen time, built a journaling habit, felt more clarity, processed emotions better, slept better after evening journaling
