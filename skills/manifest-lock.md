# Manifest Lock — Product Knowledge

## What It Is

An iOS app that blocks distracting apps until users complete daily manifestation/affirmation practices. Users write manifestations, read them aloud, and their apps stay locked until they finish their daily practice.

## Core Value Propositions (ranked by hook potential)

1. **"Earn your screen time"** — apps are blocked until you practice. This is the unique mechanic that separates us from every other manifestation app. Lead with this in [[hook-architecture]] Tier 1 and Tier 2 hooks.
2. **"3 minutes that replace 3 hours of scrolling"** — time swap framing. Works especially well for [[text-overlays]] POV openers.
3. **"Your phone makes you read your goals out loud before you can open Instagram"** — the visceral description. Best for curiosity-gap hooks.
4. **"Build a streak that actually changes your habits"** — gamification angle. Best for [[content-mix]] Category C (streak/transformation).
5. **"AI writes personalized affirmations based on your mood and goals"** — tech angle. Use sparingly, mostly for Category D (app demo).

## Persona

All ManifestLock content is posted by [[emilly]] (1 account: @emillywilks). Emilly's warm, vulnerable, overthinker voice is the lens through which this app is presented.

## Target Audience

### Primary: The Doom Scroller (18-28)
Knows they waste hours on their phone, feels guilty about it. Hook angle: screen time stats, "what if you used that time differently."

### Secondary: The Manifestation Curious (22-35)
Interested in manifestation but can't build the habit. Hook angle: "I tried manifesting for 30 days, here's what happened."

### Tertiary: The Self-Improver (25-40)
Wants intentional mornings and routines. Hook angle: productivity, habit building. Emilly's warm energy fits this audience well.

## App Features (Content-Relevant)

Use these in screen recordings and [[text-overlays]] reaction moments:

- **Mood check** (emoji slider) — visually appealing, shows the practice is personalized
- **Alignment check** — "how aligned are you with your goals today?"
- **AI manifestation generation** — personalized based on goal + mood
- **Read aloud with audio visualizer** — the core practice, visually distinct
- **App blocking with shield overlay** — the "earn your screen time" mechanic, the money shot for demos
- **Streak tracking** — gamification, shareable milestones (Day 7, Day 30, etc.)
- **Unlock timer with countdown** — visual urgency, good for reaction moments
- **Video theme backgrounds** (Sky, Aurora, Beach, Moonlight, Waterfall) — screenshot-worthy

## What We Never Say

- Never claim the app will make you rich, find love, or get promoted — see [[what-never-works]]
- Never directly ask people to download — see [[tiktok]] "never name the app" rule
- Credible claims only: reduced screen time, built a streak, felt more focused, stuck to a routine
