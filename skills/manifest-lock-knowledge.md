# Manifest Lock — Product Knowledge Base

## What It Is
An iOS app that combines daily manifestation/affirmation practices with Screen Time
app blocking for accountability. Users write manifestations, read them aloud,
and their distracting apps stay locked until they complete their daily practice.

## Core Value Propositions (ranked by marketing potential)
1. "Earn your screen time" — apps are blocked until you practice (unique, sticky hook)
2. "3 minutes that replace 3 hours of scrolling" — time swap framing
3. "Your phone makes you read your goals out loud before you can open Instagram"
4. "Build a streak that actually changes your habits" — gamification angle
5. "AI writes personalized affirmations based on your mood and goals" — tech angle
