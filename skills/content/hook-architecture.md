# Hook Architecture

## The 3-Second Rule

TikTok and Reels give ~3 seconds before users scroll. The hook must:

1. Create an emotion (shock, curiosity, relatability)
2. Promise a payoff ("here's what happened", "watch this")
3. Feel personal, not promotional

The hook determines the POV text overlay (see [[text-overlays]]) and the caption opening (see [[caption-formulas]]). Everything downstream depends on it.

## Hook Tiers (Ranked by Performance)

### Tier 1: Conflict + Resolution

"[Person] [doubted/laughed/didn't believe] → I showed them [thing] → [unexpected result]"

- Works because: social proof + story arc + curiosity gap
- Best for: [[content-mix]] Category B (Reaction/Story)
- Example: "My therapist didn't believe manifestation works until I showed her my 30-day streak"

### Tier 2: Shocking Stat

"[Specific number] + [emotional framing] + [pivot to solution]"

- Works because: concrete data creates urgency
- Best for: [[content-mix]] Category A (Screen Time Shock)
- Example: "You'll spend 11 years of your life on your phone. Here's what that looks like"

### Tier 3: Curiosity Gap

"There's a [thing] that [unexpected behavior]"

- Works because: incomplete information drives engagement
- Best for: [[content-mix]] Category D (App Demo) and B
- Example: "There's an app that blocks your phone until you read your manifestations out loud"

### Tier 4: Challenge/Transformation

"Day [X] of [specific practice]"

- Works because: journey content builds followings
- Best for: [[content-mix]] Category C (Streak/Transformation)
- Example: "Day 14 of reading my manifestations out loud every morning"

## Hook Quality Rules (Non-Negotiable)

Every hook must pass ALL checks. These are learned from testing — see [[what-never-works]] for the full anti-pattern list.

### 1. No spam phrases
Never use "one weird trick," "you won't believe," "doctors hate this," or any phrasing that sounds like clickbait. TikTok's algorithm actively suppresses these.

### 2. Specific reactions only
"His jaw dropped" is good. "UNREAL" is lazy. The viewer should be able to picture the reaction. If you can't describe it in physical terms (jaw dropped, she went silent, she screenshot it), it's too vague.

### 3. Believable transformations only
"Screen time dropped by 4 hours" is credible. "I got promoted" from a manifestation app is not. Credible results: reduced screen time, built a streak, felt more focused, stuck to a routine. See [[manifest-lock]] for the full list of claims we can make.

### 4. Hook tells WHAT happened, slides show HOW
Don't end hooks with vague teases like "watch what happened." State the outcome. The curiosity should be about *seeing* it, not *learning* it.

- Bad: "I showed my mom my screen time. Watch what happened."
- Good: "I showed my mom I wasted 11 years on my phone. She went silent."

### 5. One emotion per hook
Don't stack "SHE CRIED" + "OH MY GOD" + "UNREAL." Pick the single most powerful beat.

### 6. ALL CAPS sparingly
One ALL CAPS word per hook maximum. Used for the single most shocking element. "11 YEARS" works. "OH MY GOD SHE CRIED UNREAL" is noise.

### 7. Numbers beat adjectives
"4 hours less screen time" beats "way less screen time." "11 years" beats "your whole life." Specific numbers create mental images. Adjectives create nothing.

## Bad vs Good Rewrites

| Bad Hook | Problem | Good Rewrite |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| "My friend bet me I couldn't cut scrolling. 7 days of tracking proved her wrong." | "Proved her wrong" doesn't say HOW (rule 4) | "My friend bet me I couldn't quit scrolling for a week. My screen time went from 6 hours to 45 minutes." |
| "I showed my mom my screen time. Watch what happened." | Vague tease (rule 4) | "I showed my mom I wasted 11 years on my phone. She went silent." |
| "My roommate tried this app and her reaction was UNREAL." | Non-physical reaction (rule 2) | "My roommate tried this app. She hasn't opened Instagram in 12 days." |
| "One weird trick to cut your screen time in HALF." | Spam phrase + vague (rules 1, 7) | "I cut my screen time from 7 hours to 40 minutes. Here's the 3-minute habit." |

## Self-Check Before Approving Any Hook

- [ ] Contains at least ONE specific number
- [ ] Reaction/outcome is physically describable or numerically measurable
- [ ] No spam phrases (weird trick, you won't believe, etc.)
- [ ] Maximum ONE word in ALL CAPS
- [ ] Tells what happened, not "watch what happened"
- [ ] Transformation is attributable to screen time reduction or daily practice
- [ ] A stranger would find the claim believable
- [ ] Matches the assigned persona's voice (check [[sanya]] or [[sophie]])
- [ ] Not too similar to recent hooks in [[proven-hooks]]

If any check fails, rewrite before proceeding to [[text-overlays]].
