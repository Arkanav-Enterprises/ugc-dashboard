# What Never Works — Anti-Patterns

## Banned Phrases (Instant Reject)

If any of these appear in a hook, overlay, or caption, rewrite immediately:

- "One weird trick"
- "You won't believe"
- "Doctors hate this"
- "This changed my life" (vague — say what changed)
- "UNREAL" / "INSANE" / "MIND-BLOWING" (lazy superlatives)
- "Check out this app"
- "Download now"
- "Link in bio"
- "Manifest Lock" in the caption (see [[tiktok]] — never name the app)

## Content That Consistently Fails

**Generic motivation:** "Believe in yourself!" — this is background noise on TikTok. Zero scroll-stopping power.

**Feature announcements:** "Our app now has..." — nobody cares about features. They care about outcomes.

**Direct selling:** "Download our app!" — triggers both algorithmic suppression and audience distrust.

**Vague claims:** "This changed my life" — changed how? Be specific or don't say it.

**No conflict/story:** "Here's a cool app" — there's no narrative tension. Why should I keep watching?

**Stacked emotions:** "OH MY GOD SHE CRIED I'M SHAKING UNREAL" — noise. Pick ONE emotion. See [[hook-architecture]] rule 5.

**Unbelievable transformations:** "I manifested and got promoted" or "I found my soulmate through affirmations." Keep claims credible: reduced screen time, built a streak, felt more focused, stuck to a routine. See [[manifest-lock]] for allowed claims.

## Formatting Anti-Patterns

- ALL CAPS for more than one word → feels like shouting, algorithm may suppress
- Emoji walls (✨🙏💫🌙) → signals spam, not authenticity
- Hashtag walls (15+ hashtags) → signals desperation
- Caption that explains the video → if the caption needs to explain it, the video failed
- Multiple CTAs → confuses the viewer, lowers conversion on all of them

## Repetition Anti-Patterns

- Same hook formula three days in a row → audience fatigues, algorithm deprioritizes
- Same text overlay wording on both personas → breaks the illusion of two real people
- Same screen recording in back-to-back posts → viewers notice, engagement drops

Always check [[proven-hooks]] before generating to avoid accidental repetition.

## Voice Anti-Patterns Per Persona

### [[sanya]] should never sound like:
- A productivity bro ("5 HACKS to fix your screen time")
- A salesperson ("You need to try this")
- Detached/analytical ("The data shows a 73% reduction")

### [[sophie]] should never sound like:
- A spiritual influencer ("Manifesting abundance ✨")
- Overly emotional ("I'm literally sobbing right now")
- Corporate ("We're excited to announce")
