# Caption Formulas

## The Role of the Caption

The caption is NOT the hook — that job belongs to the [[text-overlays]] POV opener. The caption supplements the video with:

1. Story context or emotional framing
2. A soft call to action (never "download now")
3. Hashtags for discoverability

Most viewers never read the caption on first view. They read it AFTER the video hooks them. Write for the second-watch reader.

## Caption Structure

```
[Opening line — story hook or emotional setup]
[1-2 sentences of context]
[Soft CTA or question]

[Hashtags — separate line]
```

Total length: 100-200 characters before hashtags. Shorter is better on TikTok (see [[tiktok]]).

## Caption Templates by Category

### Category A — Screen Time Shock
```
I didn't believe it until I saw the numbers. [X] hours a day, every day, for years.
That's [Y] years gone. Just... gone.
What would you do with [Y] extra years?

#screentime #phonefree #digitaldetox #manifestation #morningroutine
```

### Category B — Reaction/Story
```
She thought I was being dramatic. Then I showed her my 30-day streak.
The look on her face when she saw my screen time go from 7 hours to 40 minutes.
Now she's on day 3 💀

#manifestation #screentime #accountability #digitaldetox #habits
```

### Category C — Streak/Transformation
```
Day [X]. It started as a joke, honestly.
"Read your manifestations out loud" — sounds like something my aunt would forward.
But [X] days later and my screen time speaks for itself.

#manifestation #streak #screentime #morningroutine #selfimprovement
```

### Category D — App Demo
```
My phone now has opinions about how I start my morning.
Can't open anything until I read my manifestations out loud.
Honestly? I don't hate it.

#manifestation #appblocking #screentime #digitaldetox #habits
```

## Persona-Specific Caption Tone

### For [[sanya]] (@sanyahealing)
- More emotional, uses "..." for pauses
- Slightly vulnerable: "I didn't think this would work"
- Can use emoji sparingly (1-2 max, never as decoration)
- Asks reflective questions: "does anyone else feel this way?"

### For [[sophie]] (@sophie.unplugs)
- Dry, factual, short sentences
- Reluctant admission: "fine. it works."
- Minimal emoji (maybe 💀 or 😭 for irony, never ✨🙏)
- Asks confrontational questions: "what's your screen time right now? be honest."

## CTA Patterns (Soft Only)

**NEVER** say:
- "Download the app"
- "Link in bio"
- "Try Manifest Lock"

See [[tiktok]] for why — naming the app kills comment engagement.

**DO say:**
- "What would you do with [X] extra hours?"
- "Would you try this?"
- "Drop your screen time in the comments"
- "Tag someone who needs this"
- Nothing at all — sometimes the video speaks for itself

## Hashtag Rules

### TikTok (see [[tiktok]])
- Max 5 hashtags
- Mix: 2 niche (#manifestation, #screentime) + 2 medium (#morningroutine, #habits) + 1 broad (#fyp or trending)
- No hashtag walls — they signal spam

### Instagram (see [[instagram]])
- 5-10 hashtags
- Same mix logic but can include more niche ones
- Put in caption, not first comment (algorithm change 2025)

## Caption Anti-Patterns

See [[what-never-works]] for the full list. Key ones for captions:
- Don't repeat the text overlay word-for-word in the caption
- Don't explain the video — if the caption needs to explain what happened, the video failed
- Don't use multiple CTAs — one or zero
- Don't hashtag stuff like #viral #trending #foryou — they don't work and signal desperation
