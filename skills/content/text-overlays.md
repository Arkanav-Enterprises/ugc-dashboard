# Text Overlays — On-Screen Text for Reaction Videos

## Two Overlay Moments

Every post has two text overlay moments, corresponding to the two persona clips in the [[video-format]]:

1. **POV opener** — appears on the first clip (persona with hand over mouth)
2. **Reaction text** — appears on the final clip (persona smiling/reacting)

Between them is a screen recording with no persona overlay — the app speaks for itself.

## POV Opener Patterns

This is the hook in text form. It appears on screen while the persona covers her mouth in disbelief/surprise. The text should explain WHY she's reacting.

### Format Rules
- Always lowercase (feels casual, native to TikTok)
- Starts with "pov:" most of the time (but not always — vary it)
- Short enough to read in 2-3 seconds
- Max 2 lines on screen
- White text with black shadow/stroke for readability

### Templates by Category

**Category A — Screen Time Shock:**
- "pov: you check your screen time and it says [specific number]"
- "pov: you realize you've spent [X years] of your life on your phone"
- "when you see how many hours you wasted this week on [app name]"
- "[X] hours. that's how long I was on my phone yesterday."

**Category B — Reaction/Story:**
- "pov: your [person] catches you talking to your phone at 6am"
- "pov: you show your [person] your screen time and they go silent"
- "when your [person] asks why you're up before them for the first time ever"
- "i told my [person] I manifest every morning. their face."

**Category C — Streak/Transformation:**
- "pov: day [X] of reading your manifestations out loud"
- "pov: you hit a [X]-day streak and your whole routine changed"
- "week 1 me vs week 4 me"
- "what [X] days of manifesting actually did to my screen time"

**Category D — App Demo:**
- "pov: you try to open instagram but your phone has other plans"
- "there's an app that won't let you scroll until you manifest"
- "what happens when you try to open tiktok before reading your manifestations"
- "my phone at 7am every morning:"

### Persona-Specific Adjustments

For [[sanya]]: lean into emotional framing, use "I" and "you" interchangeably, slightly longer overlays are okay because her energy is more intimate.

For [[sophie]]: lean into dry/deadpan framing, shorter text, the humor is in the restraint. "my screen time did what now" > "omg I can't believe my screen time dropped."

## Reaction Text Patterns

This appears on the second persona clip — she's smiling, surprised, or amused. The text is a short punchline or emotional payoff.

### Format Rules
- Very short: 2-6 words ideal
- Can use punctuation for emphasis: "...WHAT", "okay??", "i—"
- One ALL CAPS word max (same rule as [[hook-architecture]])
- Should feel like an involuntary reaction, not a crafted statement

### Templates

**Genuine surprise:**
- "i mean...WHAT"
- "wait this actually works??"
- "okay I'm never going back"
- "it just...works?"
- "hold on"

**Dry/understated (best for [[sophie]]):**
- "the app ate"
- "okay fine it works"
- "i'm not even mad"
- "well that happened"
- "fair enough"
- "noted."

**Emotional (best for [[sanya]]):**
- "i needed this"
- "why did this make me feel things"
- "okay I'm obsessed"
- "this is my sign"
- "manifesting hits different now"

**Celebratory (for streak content):**
- "[X] days and counting"
- "we're so back"
- "the streak is REAL"
- "consistency > everything"

## Pairing Rules

The POV opener and reaction text should form a micro-arc:

| POV Opener | Screen Recording | Reaction Text |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Sets up the situation | Shows proof | Delivers the payoff |
| Creates tension | Resolves with evidence | Emotional landing |
| "pov: your screen time is 7 hours" | App blocking → practice → unlock | "47 minutes. that's it." |
| "pov: day 1 of manifesting" | Streak screen at Day 30 | "we're so back" |
| "pov: you show your mom the app" | Screen recording of practice | "she downloaded it." |

Never repeat the same emotion in both overlays. If the opener is shock, the reaction should be satisfaction or humor. If the opener is curiosity, the reaction should be confirmation or surprise.
