# Content Mix — Weekly Category Balance

## The Four Categories

Every post falls into one category. The mix determines reach vs conversion balance.

### Category A — Screen Time Shock (40% of posts)

**What it is:** Stats, numbers, and data that make doom-scrolling feel visceral. The audience's own behavior reflected back at them in shocking terms.

**Why 40%:** Highest reach potential. These hooks get shared because they feel personally attacking — people tag friends with "this is literally you."

**Best persona:** [[sophie]] for ManifestLock (dry confrontation), [[sanya]] for JournalLock (personal/emotional).

**Hook patterns from [[hook-architecture]]:** Tier 2 (Shocking Stat) and Tier 1 (Conflict + Resolution with stats).

**Example hooks:**
- ManifestLock: "You'll spend 11 years of your life on your phone. Here's what that looks like."
- ManifestLock: "My screen time went from 8 hours to 47 minutes in 30 days"
- JournalLock: "pov: you check your screen time and it's 7 hours 23 minutes. then your phone locks."
- JournalLock: "i replaced doom scrolling with 3 minutes of journaling. my screen time did what now."

### Category B — Reaction/Story Hooks (30% of posts)

**What it is:** Someone discovers/tries the app and has a reaction. Social proof through narrative. The "I showed someone and they..." format.

**Why 30%:** Proven viral formula. Story arcs create emotional investment that stats alone can't.

**Best persona:** [[sophie]] for skeptic-turned-believer arcs (ManifestLock), [[sanya]] for emotional reactions (JournalLock).

**Hook patterns from [[hook-architecture]]:** Tier 1 (Conflict + Resolution) dominates this category.

**Example hooks:**
- ManifestLock: "My roommate laughed when I said I manifest every morning. Day 21 she asked me to teach her."
- ManifestLock: "I told my therapist I talk to my phone for 3 minutes every morning. Her face."
- JournalLock: "my mom saw me journaling instead of scrolling and thought something was wrong"
- JournalLock: "i told my friend an app locks my phone until I journal. she downloaded it the same night."

### Category C — Streak/Transformation (15% of posts)

**What it is:** Journey content. Day X updates, milestone celebrations, before/after comparisons. Community building through shared progress.

**Why 15%:** Lower reach than A/B but builds loyal followers who come back. Streak content creates FOMO in viewers who aren't participating.

**Best persona:** [[sophie]] for reluctant-progress (ManifestLock), [[sanya]] for celebratory/emotional (JournalLock).

**Hook patterns from [[hook-architecture]]:** Tier 4 (Challenge/Transformation).

**Example hooks:**
- ManifestLock: "Day 30 of reading my manifestations out loud. Here's what actually changed."
- ManifestLock: "Week 1 vs Week 4 of manifesting every morning"
- JournalLock: "pov: you hit a 21-day journaling streak and your brain is quieter than it's been in years"
- JournalLock: "day 14 of journaling before bed. i sleep now."

### Category D — App Demo (15% of posts)

**What it is:** Direct product content showing the app in action. Features, UI, the blocking mechanic. This is conversion content, not reach content.

**Why 15%:** Lower viral potential but highest conversion rate per view. Viewers who watch app demos are the warmest leads.

**Best persona:** [[sophie]] — her "just showing you what happened" framing makes ManifestLock demos feel organic. [[sanya]] can work for JournalLock mood check / prompt demos (the emotional features).

**Example hooks:**
- ManifestLock: "pov: you open Instagram but your phone makes you read your manifestations first"
- ManifestLock: "what my screen looks like every morning at 7am"
- JournalLock: "pov: you try to open tiktok but your phone says 'journal first'"
- JournalLock: "what happens when you try to scroll before writing about your day"

## Assigning Categories to Accounts

With 3 posts per day (Sophie ×2 for ManifestLock, Sanya ×1 for JournalLock):

| Day | @sophie.unplugs (ML) | @emillywilks (ML) | @sanyahealing (JL) |
|-----|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Mon | Category A | Category B | Category A |
| Tue | Category B | Category A | Category B |
| Wed | Category A | Category C | Category C |
| Thu | Category D | Category A | Category A |
| Fri | Category B | Category B | Category B |
| Sat | Category A | Category D | Category A |
| Sun | Category C | Category A | Category C |

**Critical rule:** Sophie's two accounts must NEVER have the same category or hook on the same day. See [[sophie]] for differentiation rules.

This gives roughly: A=40%, B=30%, C=15%, D=10% per account — with flex. The autopilot uses weighted random selection within these ratios.

## When Performance Data Overrides the Mix

If [[proven-hooks]] shows a category consistently outperforming, shift 10% of the mix toward it. But never let any category drop below 10% — diversity prevents audience fatigue. Check [[performance-loop]] for the weekly review process.
