# Content Strategy — Manifest Lock Social Media

## Guiding Principles

1. Every post tells a STORY — never a feature list
2. Hook must create conflict, curiosity, or shock in under 2 seconds
3. The app is the solution, never the subject
4. First person, authentic voice — never corporate
5. Test aggressively, kill what doesn't work, double down on winners

## Account Warmup (Days 1-2 Before First Post)

Do NOT post on a new account immediately. The algorithm needs to learn
who your audience is first.

1. **Day 1-2**: Scroll 15 min/day in your target niche ONLY (manifestation,
   screen time, self-improvement, habit building). Like, comment, follow
   creators in that space.
2. **Why**: TikTok's algorithm categorizes your account by what you engage
   with. If you post before training it, your content gets pushed to random
   audiences and dies.
3. **Never buy old accounts** — they have a locked-in audience you can't change.
4. **Same email for multiple TikTok accounts is fine** if scaling later.
5. After warmup, start with 1 post/day. Scale to 3/day only after finding
   a format that works.

## Content Mix (Weekly)

- 40% Screen Time Shock (Category A) — highest reach potential
- 30% Reaction/Story Hooks (Category B) — proven viral formula
- 15% Streak/Transformation (Category C) — community building
- 10% App Demo (Category D) — direct conversion
- 5% UGC Reaction Videos — higher production value

## Hook Architecture

### The 3-Second Rule

TikTok gives you ~3 seconds before users scroll. The hook must:

1. Create an emotion (shock, curiosity, relatability)
2. Promise a payoff ("here's what happened", "watch this")
3. Feel personal, not promotional

### Hook Templates (Ranked by Performance)

#### Tier 1: Conflict + Resolution

"[Person] [doubted/laughed/didn't believe] → I showed them [thing] → [unexpected result]"

- Works because: social proof + story arc + curiosity gap
- Example: "My therapist didn't believe manifestation works until I showed her my 30-day streak"

#### Tier 2: Shocking Stat

"[Specific number] + [emotional framing] + [pivot to solution]"

- Works because: concrete data creates urgency
- Example: "You'll spend 11 years of your life on your phone. Here's what that looks like"

#### Tier 3: Curiosity Gap

"There's a [thing] that [unexpected behavior]"

- Works because: incomplete information drives engagement
- Example: "There's an app that blocks your phone until you read your manifestations out loud"

#### Tier 4: Challenge/Transformation

"Day [X] of [specific practice]"

- Works because: journey content builds followings
- Example: "Day 14 of reading my manifestations out loud every morning"

### What NEVER Works (Do Not Use)

- Generic motivation ("Believe in yourself!")
- Feature announcements ("Our app now has...")
- Direct selling ("Download our app!")
- Vague claims ("This changed my life")
- No conflict/story ("Here's a cool app")

### Hook Quality Rules (Learned from Testing)

These rules are non-negotiable. Every hook must pass ALL of these checks:

1. **No spam phrases.** Never use "one weird trick," "you won't believe,"
   "doctors hate this," or any phrasing that sounds like 2014 clickbait.
   TikTok's algorithm actively suppresses these.

2. **Specific reactions only.** "His jaw dropped" is good. "UNREAL" or
   "you won't believe what happened" is lazy. The viewer should be able
   to picture the reaction. If you can't describe it in physical terms
   (jaw dropped, she went silent, she screenshot it), it's too vague.

3. **Believable transformations only.** "Screen time dropped by 4 hours" is
   credible. "I got promoted" from using a manifestation app is not.
   The result must be directly attributable to the practice. Good results:
   reduced screen time, built a streak, felt more focused, stuck to a routine.
   Bad results: got rich, got promoted, found my soulmate.

4. **The hook tells WHAT happened. The slides show HOW.** Don't end hooks
   with vague teases like "watch what happened" or "her reaction?"
   Instead, state the outcome in the hook. The curiosity should be about
   seeing it, not about what it is. Compare:

   - Bad: "I showed my mom my screen time. Watch what happened."
   - Good: "I showed my mom I wasted 11 years on my phone. She went silent."

5. **One emotion per hook.** Don't stack "SHE CRIED" + "OH MY GOD" +
   "UNREAL." Pick the single most powerful emotional beat and commit to it.

6. **ALL CAPS sparingly.** One ALL CAPS word per hook maximum. Used for the
   single most shocking element. "11 YEARS" works. "OH MY GOD SHE CRIED
   UNREAL" is noise.

7. **Numbers beat adjectives.** "4 hours less screen time" beats "way less
   screen time." "11 years" beats "your whole life." Specific numbers
   create images. Adjectives create nothing.

### Bad vs Good Rewrites

Study these rewrites. They show exactly what "following the rules" looks like.

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "My friend bet me I couldn't cut scrolling. 7 days of tracking proved her wrong."         | "Proved her wrong" doesn't say HOW. Violates rule 4.                  | "My friend bet me I couldn't quit scrolling for a week. My screen time went from 6 hours to 45 minutes." |
| "Productivity review flagged my screen time. 30 days later, my focus changed everything." | "Changed everything" is vague. Violates rule 7.                       | "Productivity review flagged my 8-hour screen time. 30 days later, it was under 2 hours."                |
| "I showed my mom my screen time. Watch what happened."                                    | Ends with vague tease. Violates rule 4.                               | "I showed my mom I wasted 11 years on my phone. She went silent."                                        |
| "My roommate tried this app and her reaction was UNREAL."                                 | "UNREAL" is not a physical reaction. Violates rule 2.                 | "My roommate tried this app. She hasn't opened Instagram in 12 days."                                    |
| "I tracked my screen time and OH MY GOD SHE CRIED."                                       | Multiple emotions stacked, ALL CAPS overused. Violates rules 5 and 6. | "I tracked my screen time for a month. My dad didn't say a word for 10 minutes."                         |
| "One weird trick to cut your screen time in HALF."                                        | Spam phrase + vague. Violates rules 1 and 7.                          | "I cut my screen time from 7 hours to 40 minutes. Here's the 3-minute habit."                            |

### Self-Check Before Submitting Any Hook

Before finalizing a hook, verify:

- [ ] Contains at least ONE specific number
- [ ] Reaction/outcome is physically describable or numerically measurable
- [ ] No spam phrases (weird trick, you won't believe, etc.)
- [ ] Maximum ONE word in ALL CAPS
- [ ] Tells what happened, not "watch what happened"
- [ ] Transformation is directly attributable to screen time or daily practice
- [ ] A stranger would find the claim believable

## Platform-Specific Rules

### TikTok

- Slideshows: 6 slides, portrait, text overlay on slide 1 only
- Caption: story-style, soft CTA, max 5 hashtags
- Sound: add trending sound manually before publishing
- Best times to test: 8am, 1pm, 7pm (adjust based on analytics)
- Draft mode first, review before publishing
- **NEVER name the app in the caption.** Let people ask "what app is this?"
  in the comments. Comments are TikTok's #1 ranking signal. Every comment
  asking about the app is free algorithmic reach AND a warm lead. Reply
  to each one individually — each reply counts as another comment.
- **500-view floor rule.** If you can't break 500 views after 5+ consistent
  posts, pause for 2-3 days. The problem is content quality, not frequency.
  Posting more bad content trains the algorithm to suppress your account.
  During the pause, study what's working for competitors (sort by Popular)
  and come back with a new angle.

### Instagram Reels (Future — Week 3+)

- Repurpose TikTok content with minor tweaks
- Remove TikTok watermark if cross-posting video
- Hashtag strategy differs: up to 30 but 5-10 performs best
- Reels algorithm favors saves and shares over likes

## A/B Testing Framework

- Test ONE variable at a time (hook, image style, CTA, posting time)
- Minimum 5 posts per variant before drawing conclusions
- Track in memory/hook-results.md with date, hook, views, engagement rate
- Winner = highest engagement rate (likes+comments+shares / views), not just views

## Iteration Cycle

1. Post 3x/day for 1 week
2. Sunday review: identify top 3 and bottom 3 performers
3. Analyze what the top 3 share (hook type, image style, time, topic)
4. Create next week's content leaning into winners
5. Update skill files with new insights
6. Repeat
