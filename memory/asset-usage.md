## Retired Asset Types (DO NOT USE)

- **UGC lighting** — 100-130 views consistently. Studio lighting reads as produced, not authentic.
- **Outdoor** — 100-130 views. Doesn't match intimate/confessional tone of winning hooks.
- All reference images ending in `-ugc.jpeg` or `-outdoor.jpeg/png` are retired.
