## Account Performance Summary (as of 2026-02-27)

| Account | Persona | App | 30d Views | Reels Posted | Avg Views/Reel | Engagement Quality |
|---------|---------|-----|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| @aliyah.manifests | Aliyah | ManifestLock | 5,800 | ~8 | ~800 | ⭐ Best — comments asking about app name |
| @aliyah.journals | Aliyah | JournalLock | 3,600 | ~8 | ~450 (4/8 reels >700) | ⭐ Strong — comments asking about app name |
| @emillywilks | Emilly | ManifestLock | 2,900 | ~15 | ~150-200 | Consistent but low ceiling |
| @sanyahealing | Sanya | JournalLock | 2,600 | ~13 | ~130-140 (one 1,349 outlier) | Volume play, one breakout |
| @riley.manifests | Riley | ManifestLock | 1,200 | 6 | ~200 (spiky: 1×500, 1×1,144) | New, promising spikes |
| @riley.journals | Riley | JournalLock | ~1,000* | 5 | ~200 | New, dashboard shows 151 (inaccurate) |
| @sophie.unplugs | Sanya | JournalLock | 587 | 6 | ~130-140 | Weakest performer |

*Riley.journals dashboard shows 151 views for 30 days but individual reel views add up higher — dashboard metric likely measures profile views, not reel views.

## Winning Hooks (High Views — Riff on These)

| Hook Pattern | Persona | Views | Why It Worked |
|-------------|---------|-------|---------------|
| "my phone won't unlock until i trauma dump" | Aliyah | 1,753 | Dramatic + relatable, "trauma dump" is Gen Z language, creates curiosity |
| "my phone guilt trips me with a tiny/dying plant now" | Aliyah | 1,160-1,486 | Unexpected metaphor (plant = guilt), funny + intriguing |
| "my boss saw my screen time was 9 hours a day" | Sanya | 1,349 | Social shame angle, universally relatable, specific number |
| "my phone won't let me text him back until i write" | Riley | 1,144 | Relationship angle + "can't text him back" creates tension |
| "my phone literally won't let me scroll until i say nice things about myself" | Riley | 532 | Self-love angle, relatable inner conflict |
| "got my co-worker i spend more than 8 hrs on my phone" | Emilly | 849 | Social proof + shocking stat, social context |

**Pattern in winners:** Phone personification ("my phone won't/guilt trips/makes me") + emotional stakes (shame, relationships, self-worth) + specific details (numbers, people, situations).

## Dead Hooks (Consistently Underperform)

| Hook Pattern | Avg Views | Why It Failed |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| Generic "my phone won't let me scroll/be toxic anymore" variations | 100-120 | Too vague, no specific emotional stake or surprise |
| Outdoor video type hooks | 100-130 | Visual doesn't match intimate/confessional tone of the hook |
| UGC lighting video type hooks | 100-130 | Studio lighting feels less authentic than default setting |

## Patterns

### What's Working
1. **Default clothing/setting videos outperform UGC lighting and outdoor by 3-8x on views.** This is consistent across ALL personas and accounts. The casual, unpolished look reads as more authentic.
2. **Aliyah persona outperforms all others by 3-4x on average views.** She gets the most engagement and is the only persona where viewers consistently ask for the app name in comments.
3. **Phone personification hooks** ("my phone won't let me...", "my phone guilt trips me...") are the strongest hook format. They create curiosity and feel relatable.
4. **Hooks with specific social context** (boyfriend, boss, therapist, sister, co-worker) outperform generic first-person hooks. Adding a person creates a mini-story.
5. **Emotional escalation** (guilt, shame, surprise) in the hook drives views. Pure feature-description hooks ("this app blocks your phone") get ignored.
6. **Riley showing early breakout potential** — only 6 reels on ManifestLock but already has a 1,144-view hit. Distribution is spiky (high variance = algorithm testing).
7. **ManifestLock accounts outperform JournalLock accounts** on the same persona (Aliyah manifests 5.8K > Aliyah journals 3.6K; Riley manifests 1.2K > Riley journals ~1K).

### What's NOT Working
1. **UGC lighting and outdoor video types** — consistently 100-130 views regardless of hook quality. Stop generating these types. Default clothing only.
2. **Sanya persona** — @sophie.unplugs is weakest at 587 views across 6 reels. @sanyahealing (also Sanya) does better through sheer volume (13 reels) but per-reel average is still 130-140.
3. **High volume + low per-reel views** — @emillywilks has 15 reels but only 2.9K total views. Posting more doesn't help if individual reels aren't resonating. Better to post fewer, higher-quality reels.
4. **Repetitive hooks** — @emillywilks grid shows many "my phone literally won't let me spiral anymore" variations. Audience sees the same pattern and scrolls past.

### Best Posting Times
- Not enough controlled data yet to determine. Needs A/B testing.

### Audience Signals
- **Aliyah accounts get comments asking "what app is this?"** — this is the highest-intent signal possible. Means viewers want to download.
- **One instance of same on sophie.unplugs** — but rare.
- **No reports of negative comments or "this is AI" detection** — avatars passing the authenticity test so far.
- **Plant-guilt hooks generate the most curiosity** — the unusual/unexpected metaphor drives people to watch and comment.
