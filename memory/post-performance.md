<!-- Example: -->
<!-- | 2026-02-20 | reel/sanya | sanya | showed my therapist my screen time | 2400 | 23 | 12 | 0.96% | strong curiosity hook, posted 9am | -->

## Winning Hooks (Save Rate > 5% — Riff on These)

<!-- Move hooks here once they prove out. Include the format and angle so Claude can create variations. -->
<!-- Format: Hook text | Type | Save Rate | Why it worked -->

## Dead Hooks (Never Use Again)

<!-- Hooks that consistently underperform. Be specific about why so Claude avoids the pattern, not just the words. -->
<!-- Format: Hook text | Type | Save Rate | Why it failed -->

## Patterns

<!-- Update weekly. This is what Claude actually uses to make decisions. -->
<!-- Be specific: "UGC reels get 2.5x the reach of slideshows" not "reels do better" -->

### What's Working
<!-- e.g. Personal story hooks outperform stat hooks by 2x on saves -->

### What's NOT Working
<!-- e.g. Category D app demos get <500 reach consistently -->

### Best Posting Times
<!-- e.g. 8-10am IST for reels, 12-2pm for slideshows -->

### Audience Signals
<!-- What are people commenting? What questions do they ask? What do they share most? -->
